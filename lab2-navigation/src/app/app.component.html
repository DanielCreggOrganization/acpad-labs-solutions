<!--
1. The <ion-app> tag is the root container for an Ionic app.
   It is required for every Ionic app and is the first component Ionic loads.
2. The <ion-router-outlet> is where Ionic will load all of the page components for the app. 
   This is where the app will load the home page, and any other pages the app uses.
